# SKA_docs_ForNF
This repository contains labeled requirements sourced from two of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA)'s publicly available requirements documents (one document relates to the design of a dish element, while the other describes a correlator and beamformer). Requirements are labeled as either "functional" or "nonfunctional" according to the following definitions:

- functional: "what a product must do, be able to perform, or should do" (Morkos et al. 2014)
- nonfunctional: all requirements that are not functional

The definitional for nonfucntional requirements is admittedly weak, but is used here to create a binary classification task that encompasses all requirements.
